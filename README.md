# SharpAES

## This is a program that I made to be less bored. There might be bugs and fixes will probably not be very quick.

This program will, hopefully, let you encrypt some text using AES.
Support for the encryption of files might come later if I have time.

## Visual Studio 2022 is required to run this program, along with .NET 8.0 or later.

More stuff will be added to this README in due course.
